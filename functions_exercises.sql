# Find all employees hired in the 90s and born on Christmas â€” 362 rows.
# Change the query for employees hired in the 90s and born on Christmas such
# that the first result is the oldest employee who was hired last. It should be Khun Bernini.
# For your query of employees born on Christmas and hired in the 90s,
# use datediff() to find how many days they have been working at the company (Hint: You might also need to use now() or curdate()).
